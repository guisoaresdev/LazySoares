# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim Personal Config

A starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).

Usually configuring your own config from the scratch takes a lot of time and it requires me to constantly fix breaking changes which is something I don't really wanna spend too much time on it, So I'll be adapting this LazyVim config from folke to fit my needs.

Linux/MacOS Installation:
```
git clone https://github.com/guisoaresdev/LazySoares.git ~/.config/nvim
```

Windows:
```
git clone https://github.com/guisoaresdev/LazySoares.git $env:LOCALAPPDATA\nvim
```
