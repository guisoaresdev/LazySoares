# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim Personal Config

A starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).

Usually configuring your own config from the scratch takes a lot of time and it requires me to constantly fix breaking changes which is something I don't really wanna spend too much time on it, So I'll be adapting this LazyVim config from folke to fit my needs.
